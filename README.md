# 🚀 Startup Building Notes Repository

A concise, actionable reference for launching and scaling consumer-facing AI products. This repo contains distilled notes from two field-tested playbooks:

| File | Source | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **`startup_playbook_notes.md`** | *Startup Playbook: Key Takeaways & Actionable Checklist* | Idea generation frameworks, rapid validation tactics, and growth strategies for consumer AI apps. |
| **`million_dollar_weekend_notes.md`** | *Million Dollar Weekend* by Noah Kagan | Step-by-step challenges to start, validate, and grow a business in 48 hours. |

## 🏁 Quick Start
1. **Skim the Playbook**  
   Read `startup_playbook_notes.md` to pick an AI idea using the *Founder–Problem Fit / A.I. Wave* checklists.  
2. **Run the 48-Hour Money Challenge**  
   Follow `million_dollar_weekend_notes.md` to secure three paying customers and validate demand.  
3. **Ship an MVP (≈1–4 weeks)**  
   Use boilerplates, no-code, or copilots—focus on **one killer feature**.  
4. **Iterate & Scale**  
   Conduct user interviews, apply *Law of 100*, and double down on marketing experiments that convert.

> **Pro Tip:** Keep everything scrappy. Conversation beats speculation; payment beats promises.
