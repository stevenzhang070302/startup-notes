Challenge
Million dollar weekend contract
Contract with Yourself
I, ____________ (your name), commit to working toward my dream, having fun
throughout the experience, facing my fears, and following every challenge in this
book.
My dream outcome after reading Million Dollar Weekend is:
Signature: ___________________________________
Date: ___________________________________


part 1: start it
experimenting
marketting is easy with a great product
Start small, fast and not worrying aobut what I didn't know
Focus above all else on being a starter, and experimenter, a learner.

Challenge: The dollar challenge
Ask someone you know for a dollar investment in you and your future business - one measly dollar!

Magic of NOW an not how
Challenge: NOW not how
Ask one person you respect for a business idea. Don't be afraid to act. Be afraid of living a life that seems more like a resume than an adventure.

Freedom Number
To make that dream come true, you need to first choose your freedom number.

Challenge: Choosing your freedom number.


Part 2: Build it
- Finding Million Dollar Ideas
- One minute business model
- 48 hour money challenge

Finding million dollar ideas - simple excercises to generate profitable business ideas
What was our biggest problem and did others share it? Was there a solution we were capable of creating quickly?
It is deadly to build a business without first verifying that there are paying customers.
Customers don't care about your ideas; they care about whether you can solve their problems. And you should not build your idea into a business if you don't know with 100 percent certainty that it's a solution your customers will pay for.

- Who are you selling to
- What problem you're solving
- where they are

Start with what you know
Appsumo - 
- who: found an audience of potential customers? people on reddit
- what: worked backwards to find a proble mthey wanted solved? Imgur pro at a discount
- where: time for me to flex the ask muscle and pitch some redditors

The first dollar is always the sweetest. It's momentum. It's possibility. It's fear getting its ass kicked.
Focus on Zero to $1.

No biz plan required
We get so fixated on what we want to make that we lose sight of the people who want it. - Founder First Mentality, in which entrepreneurs focus on their own experience instead of Custoemr First.

New school:
Focus on conversations with customers - dynamic back and forth
Ex: Dog walking app:
- call or text three people right now who have dogs and ask them to pay you to walk their dog
- turns out none of these dog owners have problems walking their dog - real problem is finding dog sitters when they're away
- ask for next travel dates and have them pay you a deposit

Ex: Jennifer posting to her Facebook page seeing if anyone is interested for cookies. Send an email to friends, family, coworkers. and church community members asking if interested in buying - include a paypal link.

Now where do you find customers?
Zone of influence

Challenge
Top three groups - who do you have easy access to that you'd be excited to help?

Business creation should always be a conversation!
Nearly every impulse we have is to be tight with our ideas by doing more
research, going off alone to build the perfect product—anything and
everything to avoid the discomfort of asking for money. This is the validation
shortcut. You have to learn to fight through this impulse. It won’t be easy,
but it’ll be worth it.

Become a Problem Seeker
The crucial first step toward entrepreneurship is to
study your own unhappiness and to think of solutions (aka business
opportunities) for you to sell.

The Idea Generators
1. What’s the most painful (aka valuable) problem you can solve for
people . . .
2. That you also have passion for and/or unique expertise in . . .
3. For the largest niche possible that you belong to and understand . .

Challenges
1. Solve Your Own Problems
- What is one thing this morning that irritated me?
- What is one thing on my to-do list that’s been there over a week?
- What is one thing that I regularly fail to do well?
- What is one thing I wanted to buy recently only to find out that no
one made it?

2. Bestsellers Are Your Best Friends
- Write down two accessorizing ideas

3. Marketplaces
- Visit a marketplace like Etsy, Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or
eBay and write at least one idea for a product or service

4. Search Engine Queries

# One-minute Business Model
- Is this a million dollar opportunity?
- What's my model?
- What if it turns out it's not going to work?

Step 1. Find $1 Million Worth of Customers
Even if you’re a great surfer with an amazing board, you will still fail if
you don’t have a good wave to ride.
What I’m
saying here is that your job is not to create demand for something that seems
exciting, it’s to find existing demand and satisfy it  
In order to have a million-dollar business, you need a million-dollar
opportunity

1. Is the overall market dying, flat, or growing? You want flat or
ideally growing!
2. Is this a million-dollar opportunity? To figure that out, we have to
know the number of potential customers and the price of your product.

1. Is the market growing or dying? Search Google Trends for the
terms “beard” and “beard grooming” and compare their search
popularity to similar terms (for example, “haircuts,” “razors”) and how
that’s changed over the last few months and years. With Google Trends
you are just looking to see how the graphs are trending – ideally up and
to the right.

2. How many potential customers are there? I’d highly
recommend using Facebook Ads to research your market size.
Facebook is pretty much the entire world, and what’s phenomenal is
that they actually let you type in the keyword of whatever business
category you’re thinking about and see the approximate audience size.
You can also use the Facebook Ads Library to see every single active
ad running on Facebook for your keyword and location, which is super
helpful for uncovering competitors and getting ideas for your own
marketing efforts.

Step 2. Is This a Million-Dollar Opportunity?
Here are the major things you’re looking for:
Pick a price point you think will be ideal for your customer.
Multiply that by the number of ideal customers.
Does that equal at least a million dollars? Yes or no?
Simple!
Now let’s evaluate that on our beard oil idea:
Google Trends: Flat with some growth
Size of market: 2,500,000 people
Cost of your product: $50
Total Value: $125,000,000
Million-dollar idea? YES!

Step 3. The One-Minute Business Model
Revenue (all the money you make) – Cost (how much it costs to
make it) = Profit (what you get to take home)

PRO TIP: When you’re launching a business, always ask yourself: is
this going to be a one-off purchase, something customers buy here and there
when they want to consume it, or can you make it a monthly recurring sale?
It’s always better to be in the reorder business.
—John Paul Jones DeJoria, founder of Paul Mitchell and Patrón Spirits

Step 4. Pivot and Evolve—Your Revenue Dials

Here are the six Revenue Dials you can use:
1. Average order value: Increase the amount someone purchases.
2. Frequency: Increase how often someone will buy your service.
3. Price point: Increase or decrease your price point to affect total
sales.
4. Customer type: Approach a more lucrative/wealthier customer
segment.
5. Product line: Add additional products to make the business more
attractive to start.
6. Add-on services: If you’re selling a product like cookies, can you
offer a service like setting up birthday parties or cooking at the person’s
home?

Examples of Pivots
AppSumo started as bundle software for Silicon Valley startups
but moved to selling individual deals to marketing agencies.
Gambit started out making sports games on Facebook but found
the real opportunity in payments for social games instead.
Sam Parr’s thehustle.co went from throwing live events to
focusing just on the newsletter they used to promote the events. Fun
fact: that newsletter business sold to HubSpot for a high eight figures.

The Million-Dollar Opportunity Challenge

The hard part is not choosing which business idea. The hard part is
getting customers. And that’s where you’ll focus first.

1. Pick one business idea.
2. Make sure it’s a million-dollar opportunity.
3. Confirm your business idea is profitable.

The idea you are going to do: _____________________
Let’s check the market size:
Data/Business Idea Home Office Setup Your Idea
Google Trends Significantly up
Size of market (via Facebook Ads) 50,000
Cost $500
Market opportunity $25,000,000
Worth Pursuing? YES
If your idea is worth pursuing, now we have to make sure it’s profitable.
Calculate your profit:
Home Office Setup Your Idea
Price $ 500
Cost $ 25
Profit $ 475
Then let’s see if YOU can make a million dollars doing this business:
Home Office Setup Your Idea
Your target profit $1,000,000
Profit per unit sold $475
Total sales needed 2,105

CHAPTER 5
The 48-Hour Money Challenge
Validate Your Business by Getting Paid

Validation is finding three customers in forty-eight hours who will give you
money for your idea

Every potential business idea can be instantly verified, like your own magic wand.
The benefits of Validation are immediate and critical:
1. You don’t waste time.
2. You save money.
3. You find out if you can actually get customers for your idea.
4. You get money up front.
5. You light a fire under your butt to get moving.

The Golden Rule of Validation
Find three customers in forty-eight hours who will give you money for your idea.
Success means moving quickly and spending no money. And that’s what makes the
Golden Rule of Validation so effective. Here’s why it works so well:
You’re allowed only forty-eight hours. Limitations breed creativity.
Having a tight time limit will cut off the doubting wantrepreneur inside you
and force you to iterate fast and be creative until you find something that
works.
Get your first three customers. Your first customer is a friend, the
second customer is someone in your family, but your third customer is
HARD. You think this is easy? Then get three customers. Don’t worry about
building a business, we are ONLY validating your idea. And if it’s this hard
now, it’ll ONLY get harder.
Collect money up front. The promise of payment is not validation.
That’s polite rejection. Getting customers to hand over their dollars makes it
real. But you need to get real money, from real people. Services like PayPal,
Stripe, Cash App, and Venmo make collecting it easy these days.

You’re not trying to invent demand; you’re
trying to see how EXCITED people are about what you’re helping them with.

Three Methods to Validate ANY Business Idea
1. Direct Preselling
Validation is a conversation. Not a sales pitch, but a chat to learn about the
customer, see if you can help them and if they’ll actually pay you.

1. Listen
- What’s the most frustrating thing about what’s currently going on?
- How would having X make your life better?
- What do you think that X should cost?

2. Options
Suggest options that can solve their problems—and what they’d pay for it.
- I’ll sell you a digital course on how to fix your computer.
- What if I came over and fixed your computer myself?

3. Transition
Transition to the sell.
“So you like the idea of me coming over and fixing your computer problem. For
$50, I can do it today. Sound good?”
If they pay you, that’s Validation success.
Price + Benefit + Time.

Ex:
For $25, I will teach you how to save an hour a day on your Mac, in
just twenty minutes.
For $69, I will teach you how to write better in two hours.
For $10, I will send you a PDF with ten mind hacks that will change the
way you think in ten minutes.
For $180, I will provide six months of tasty jerky to your office this
week.

Asking for Money
There’s a big difference between what people say and what people do.
Everyone’s “interested” until they have to pay.

PRO TIP: Always follow up by sending an email to your first customers
asking for feedback. Feedback is a gift you can continually use to improve
yourself and your business.

Dealing with Rejection

That’s because every rejection is an opportunity; you can use it to take a deep
dive into customer problems. Remember the Rejection Goals from chapter 2.
Rejections are TREASURE.
When I get shot down while validating, I have a simple four-question script that
flips the no into new knowledge, new ideas, and maybe even new customers.
1. “Why not?” It’s really easy to get scared from attacking this one headon, because what happens if their criticism is right? But that’s exactly what
you want to know!
2. “Who is one person you know who would really like this?” Always,
always, always ask for a referral! Be specific about what kind of referral and
use a number; this makes it highly effective.
3. “What would make this a no-brainer for you?” If they don’t want
your product, maybe they’d want something related to it. If they don’t want
to pay for your dog care app, what about dog walking? A dog hotel? Dog
dating?
4. “What would you pay for that?” One of the hardest things in a startup
is setting prices. Getting potential customers to say what they’d pay is pure
gold!

PRO TIP: Active communications—calls and texts—work a lot better than
passive ones, like posting on Facebook or Twitter and waiting for replies. Try to
Direct Message (DM) people, or whatever enables you to get the fastest response
time possible.

2. Marketplaces
The point is, I didn’t try to find a manufacturer. I didn’t make a website. I didn’t try
to test the disc. I just said, “Will anyone actually give me money for this?” And people
did. I sold twenty of them and got an online manufacturer to make them and shipped
them to customers.
Another good technique involves posting on social media where you have an
audience of people.
My assistant Jamie was looking to develop a side hustle, so I asked her if she had
ever trained other people to be an assistant because (1) she already had the skill and
was very good at it and (2) a lot of other people wanted jobs like hers.
So she posted a message on Facebook right then: “Hey, I’m an assistant. I make a
lot of money doing it. I want to help. If you’re curious how I do it, I’m happy to help a
few other people out. Just leave a comment or message me.”

3. Landing Pages
The reason I don’t love this approach is you have to spend time setting it up and
buying ads, and when you buy ads, you have to become an ad expert. The whole
experience is slow and costly. Two things I hate.
My recommendation for you is if you feel you have to do this, limit your work to
forty-eight hours so you won’t spend a bunch of time fruitlessly playing with your ads
and landing pages or wasting money.
As an example of how to do a landing page right, take what my former intern
Justin Mares did while validating what would become the successful bone broth
company Kettle & Fire.
To start, he bought the domain bonebroths.com for $12 and set up a basic landing
page using Unbounce.
Justin paid around $5 on Fiverr to come up with the simple logo.
After setting up the page and writing the copy, he picked a price. He decided he
could make a profit if he charged $29.99 for 16 ounces. If people were willing to give
a stranger nearly $30 for a pint of a product they’d never tasted or even seen, then it
was probably destined for success.
At the site, people who hit “Order Now” got sent to a PayPal checkout, where they
were asked to send money to Justin’s email address for “Beef Marrow Bone Broth.”
The site was ugly enough to give graphic designers the cold sweats. But after
Justin bought about $50 of Bing ads, people started actually coming to the site and
PayPal-ing him money!
Over the course of the two-week test, he netted almost $500 in revenue. And now
Kettle & Fire is a $100 million company—selling broth?!?!
VALIDATED!
The key is: If you go this route, don’t overthink the design, the name, the
language, the ads, or any of that. Just focus on seeing if you can get people to buy
your product!

CHALLENGE
Validation.

Your challenge is to get at least three paying customers within forty-eight
hours.
Grab your Dream Ten list that you made earlier.
Text, call, direct message, or email—the more real time, the better!
Example script to copy:
YOU: Hey—I remember you really liked beef jerky.
POTENTIAL BUYER: Yeah, eat it all the time.
YOU: Awesome! I’m working on a new project with healthy beef jerky. Think
you’ll love it. You down to be my first customer, only $20 a month.
POTENTIAL BUYER: I don’t know, what kind of jerky?
YOU: Healthy, sourced by me, and if you don’t like it, happy to refund you.
POTENTIAL BUYER: Sounds good. Can I pay later?
YOU: Why don’t you Venmo, PayPal, or send me cash now so I can confirm
you. Only taking ten orders as part of the first batch.
POTENTIAL BUYER: Money sent.
After you’ve validated, if no one is buying, choose another idea and start over.
Head back to chapter 3 and begin again!

CHAPTER 6
Social Media Is for Growth . . .
Build an Audience Who Will Support You for
Life

A community who already knows you, who follows you, who is rooting for you
is one of the most powerful forces in business, and it’s created through generosity.

People get hooked on CHARACTERS.
People do business with REAL PEOPLE. Especially those who feel like a friend.

Finding Your Unique Angle - unfair advantage
“What’s your unique angle in thirty seconds or less?”
Ex:
“I’ve been a performance coach for the last fourteen years, working with the best
athletes in the world. Helping people perform better is my groove. I want to help
anybody who wants to have a great day and shift them into the mentality to dominate
their life. I have information to share when it comes to dealing with the best.”

1. He defines who he is,
2. Why you should trust him,
3. What he is passionate about, and
4. What unique thing this prepares him to do for you

CHALLENGE
Write out your unique angle.
There are no right answers here. You can change these any time you’d like.
1. Who are you?
2. Why should people listen?
3. What are you passionate about?
4. What will you do for people?

Pick a Platform
1. Which site has the audience you want to connect with?
2. What medium do YOU enjoy creating content in?
3. What disproportionate results will you get compared to the work you
put in?

The key principle is to start right now to build your audience and then move
them to your email list (which we’ll cover in the next chapter)

CHALLENGE
Update your bio.
Choose your one platform, and using the unique angle pitch you wrote out
before, clean up and rewrite your profile/bio on that platform to reflect who you
are and how you help your ideal customer.
Here’s my bio: Chief Sumo at @AppSumo. #30 at Facebook. Helping
entrepreneurs at Okdork.com.

Creating Content for Your Core Circle

Ali uses what I call the Content Circle Framework. The basic idea is to start with
specific topics for a tiny circle to build raving fans, then slowly expand your circle of
content to influence larger groups of people.
Here are the three steps:
1. Core Circle: Start with a very narrow audience. Ali started with the
medical school exams for British people. Your niche within a niche can be
the most obscure thing imaginable, as long as it makes you and your
audience passionate.
2. Medium Circle: As you move bigger, your content should overlap
somewhat with what concerns your Core Circle, but it should appeal to a
broader audience. Ali started talking about studying and productivity in
general, since that’s required for all students.
3. Large Circle: Here you go for the largest audience possible that’s still
related. Some of Ali’s most watched videos are about his salary—made
possible by his medical video fame—or the latest Apple product—which he
uses to increase productivity. All the circles should still include your core
audience but keep expanding your circle of influence.


To get started, identify a value that a specific group of people—your Core Circle—
want and become a reliable source of information for them. Here’s a formula you can
use—outcome you’ll deliver + target market.
Here’s an example of Content Circles for a housecleaning company:
Core Circle: How to clean your evaporative cooler + in the Southwest
USA.
Medium Circle: How to choose laundry detergents + for new
homeowners.
Large Circle: The ten best vacuums + for a family.
Once you have your outcome and market figured, you need to find a unique
viewpoint in your niche.
To come up with your unique viewpoint, ask yourself a few questions:
What is something everyone thinks is true—but you think is wrong?
What is something nobody in your target market is talking about—but
should be?
What are the biggest mistakes people in your market are making—but
are totally blind to?
Ultimately, your audience wants to learn something from you that’s relevant,
useful, and surprising. And they want to do that by going on a journey with you.

CHALLENGE
Create your own Content Circle.
Think back to your validation days: Who are the customers you want to
appeal to and what’s the outcome you can create content for? What’s the unique
point of view in your content they’d be excited to hear about?
Formula = Outcome you’ll deliver + the target market
Core Circle:
Medium Circle:
Large Circle:

Be the Guide, Not the Guru
People don’t want to be lectured at by an all-knowing guru—they want to
tag along with a guide.

The goal here is to document what YOU do, not what you think everyone else
should do.

CHALLENGE
Post one piece of content.
Now it’s time to post content publicly.
Now, this piece of content can come in any format. You know I LOVE me
some YouTube, but as you’ve seen, different niches work on different platforms.
The content you create can be a YouTube video, a Twitter thread, or a blog post.
You’ve already taken the first steps in this chapter.
1. Your Unique Angle—the secret sauce nobody else has
2. The Platform you’re going to post on
3. Your Content Circle—the narrow audience who you’ll laser-target
4. Posting it TODAY

CHAPTER 7
. . . Email Is for Profit
Use Email to Make a F*&k-Ton of Money

How to use a piece of useful free content to get people excited to sign
up for your list.
How to create a simple, effective landing page and publicize it far and
wide.
How to automate your email system so it’s sending out emails to new
subscribers twenty-four hours a day.

Your Email List Is Power
Which of these options is the most valuable for your business?
A. 100 email subscribers
B. 1,000 YouTube subscribers
C. 10,000 Instagram followers
The answer may surprise you, but it’s A. Email is the king and queen of
communicating with customers.

What percentage of your list opens every email because they feel like they know
and trust you? A healthy email list has a 20 percent open rate. Target that.

Set Up a Landing Page
Your audience needs somewhere to go to actually join your email list.

CHALLENGE
Build your landing page.

Getting Your First 100 Email Subscribers
0 to 10—The Dream Ten
What’s the easiest way to start building your list? Use your existing network.
Yes, your Dream Ten. These are people who know you and care about you. The
members of this highly engaged audience are waiting to visit, subscribe to, and share
your website and content. They are your most powerful tool for knocking over that
initial subscription domino

11 to 50—Lazy Marketing
Now that you have a landing page, you’ve got to publicize it. Obviously you’re
already doing that by putting it in your calls to action inside your videos, TikToks, or
wherever you are promoting yourself online (and in their corresponding descriptions).
But you can go a lot further by putting a link to it in every point of contact you have
with others.
That means putting the landing page address in your:
Email signature
Biography on Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook
Those offer more leverage than most people think.

CHALLENGE
Update email signature and social media bios.
Put your landing page address in your email signature and your social bios.
Send me a link to your new landing page at twitter.com/noahkagan—I’d love to
hear from you!

51 to 100—Post in Your Places
You already have a social presence. Now it’s time to post a modified version of
that email above in Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit groups—or wherever you’re
active.
Hey Everyone
Starting a “weekly” newsletter about [subject].
Go to website.com to join the newsletter.
Posting in your top places should move your total subscribers list close to 100.
Use targeted referrals to grow your list. Ask your family and friends to refer one
specific person who they think would like your newsletter. The more specific you are
when you describe the person, the more likely you are to make it easier for them to do
it. Take what I did for Sumo Jerky: “Do you know someone who makes purchase
decisions at an office—and likes a good laugh?”
Don’t forget about people you work with. I know there can be conflict, but you
have more friends than you realize who want to support you!

Growing Beyond Your First Subscribers
1. Write an insanely detailed blog post dissecting the success of and
drawing lessons from HubSpot’s content marketing approach. He spent forty
hours working on this.
2. Use social media and pretty much everything else to get that post in
front of his ideal customers.
3. Put a call to action (CTA) at the end of the post telling readers to sign
up to receive a download of growth hacks he’d put together.

Here are four examples of Lead Magnets I use:
A checklist that can be used to properly perform something I explained
in a video.
A template for determining, say, a business’s profit margin.
An advanced guide that goes further into the details of a subject of one
of my videos.
A unique book that provides substantial value but is offered for free.
For me, it is 11 Side Hustle Ideas to Make $500/Day from Your Phone.

The appropriate opt-in incentive depends on your content. Here are other types of
examples:
A DIY carpenter could offer plans to make a corner table.
A marketing YouTuber could offer scripts of what to say on sales phone
calls.
A landscaping expert might offer recommendations for which kinds of
grass to use around the United States.


CHALLENGE
Create a Lead Magnet.
It’s time to create your first Lead Magnet using the process we’ve just
outlined above. You can use your piece of content from the previous chapter as a
base or start something new. Don’t spend more than two hours on the first
iteration. If you want to turn it into a big thing later on, great. But start SMALL.

Set Up Your Cash Register

Here’s the three-step progression of emails that I’ve found works best:
1. Welcome Email
SUBJECT: You’re awesome
Thanks for joining OkDork. You are awesome!
Over 17 years of working online I’ve learned some things:
#30 at Facebook and helped launch mobile, status updates, and more
#4 at Mint and led growth to 1 million users within 1 year
Started AppSumo, which is now an $85M/year business
And now, I want to help you on your journey to living the life you want.
What could I write to provide value to you?
Love you,
Noah “tacos” Kagan
2. Connection Email
SUBJECT: Connect with me on LinkedIn
Howdy amigo,
Send me a connection request on LinkedIn to help share our relationships,
see behind-the-scenes thoughts on marketing, startups, and more . . .
Hugs,
Noah
3. Content Email
SUBJECT: Starting an 8-figure business with $50
I started AppSumo in March 2010.
In one weekend, with $50, I launched version 1 of the site. It was simple.
12 years later, Sumo Group has grown into an 8-figure business.
Starting a business can be hard. But I want to show you an easier way:
Here’s how I built AppSumo.com for $50.
Enjoy,
Noah

A MAJOR thing here is one-by-one marketing. This is personally engaging
with each new subscriber.

CHALLENGE
Set up an autoresponder.
I happen to think SendFox.com (I helped build it) is pretty darned good, but
there are a bunch of others that I recommend, like ConvertKit.com and
Mailchimp.com.

The Law of 100
Lean in and commit to 100 reps. (Think of this as doing reps and practicing as
opposed to failing or succeeding.) This changes your mindset and makes it much
easier to sustain forward motion when things get tough.

The key is to set up a system that helps you get your 100 reps done without
thinking about the results.
The solution to all the doubt that will inevitably creep up on you is to commit to
your first 100—whatever it is for you—with complete disregard for your results.
If you want to start a YouTube channel, publish 100 videos.
If you’re doing a newsletter, write 100 emails.
If you’re starting a new hobby like chess or guitar, practice for 100
days.
If you’re creating a business, directly pitch 100 customers.


CHALLENGE
The Law of 100.
Commit to doing 100 emails, posts, or whatever action will move you closer
to your goals. To live up to your commitment, use the Law of 100 Grid below to
track your progress—and don’t break the chain!

3. What is one marketing activity you can double down on?
4. How can you delight your first 100 customers?
5. If you HAD to double your business with no money in thirty days, what
would you do?

1. Set a single hyper-focused exact goal.

First off, you need to set a goal. That means choosing a number. For AppSumo in
the beginning, the goal was 100,000 email addresses. Everything else (revenue from
purchases, sharing deals, visibility, brand awareness) is rooted in that single number.
We noticed that if we could grow that number, everything else grew, too. Other
examples could be:
The monthly Freedom Number you chose in chapter 1
1,000 YouTube subscribers
$1 million in net revenue
Fifty clients
Your goal is the one number that matters most. Starting with the destination makes
planning the route much easier.

PRO TIP: Be specific. One of the most common mistakes I see from
entrepreneurs when they set goals is they say they want “more.” More revenue,
more traffic, more downloads. But how much and by when?
Now add a time frame. A terrible goal is “I want to be rich.” That’s totally
meaningless. What’s the number? A better one is “I want to be worth $1 million.”
There’s no time frame. And without a time frame, there’s no urgency. So what’s a goal
we can work with?
“I want to be worth $1 million in three years.”
Me likey.
Once you have a goal and a time frame, you can break down your goal into a
timeline of smaller targets. Besides making your goals feel more achievable, having a
timeline is crazy motivating because you get to tick off smaller wins on the way to
achieving your overall target.

2. Create your Marketing Experiment List

Source Expected Sales Actual Sales
Personal network + referrals 30 ???
Sale to Vancouver Rock Climbing Group 20 ???
Wholesale 50 ???
Marketplaces: eBay 25 ???
Giveaways 25 ???
Facebook ads 16 ???
Total 166 (his goal)

Source Expected Sales Actual Sales
Reach out to friends + referrals 30 9
Sale to Vancouver Rock Climbing Group 20 11
Wholesale options 50 217
Marketplaces—eBay 25 0
Giveaways 25 0
Facebook ads 16 0
Total 166 (his goal) 237
The point here is, you never know what’s going to work when it comes to
marketing. To find the thing that does work, what you need is a process of small
experiments—based on your BEST GUESS of what might work. It’s all about
prioritizing tactics and ruthlessly testing them!
Daniel tried six different experiments in thirty days. He thought wholesaling would
make 50 sales. Turns out it made 200+. He thought eBay would do 30 units; turns out
it did a whopping 0. So he modified his plan to go wholesale and doubled down on
that, since it made 90 percent of his sales.
Now let’s get a list of marketing strategies you can do. To do that you need to
know:
1. Who is your ideal customer?
2. Where are they?
Who is your ideal customer?
At Mint, we focused on personal finance bloggers and tech
professionals.
At AppSumo, our customer is Marketing Agency Matt, who is a
solopreneur.
At OkDork, my customer is an underdog looking for inspiration on
their business journey.
The best way I found to figure out your ideal customer is to look for patterns with
your existing ones:
Think about what’s in common with your existing customers. Certain age?
Common interest? Specific gender? Certain hobbies? From a specific area?

CHALLENGE
Who’s your customer?
Describe to me who your ideal customer is.
The MORE specific the better. Think about their gender, age, location, and
anything else that makes them unique.
Next, where can you find more of these ideal customers?

For example, with Daniel:
Who: People who rock climb outdoors at least once a week.
Where: North America/Canada, belong to a rock-climbing gym, purchase
things from sporting goods stores, read Outside magazine, are fans of Alex
Honnold (the free soloist climber), are in meetups/online groups to talk about
climbers, watch specific YouTubers who teach new climbing techniques, and eat
energy food like CLIF Bars.
If you can’t think of where, here’s a list of generic marketing ideas to get you
going:
Contacting your network: The number one place you should look for
customers is in your own existing network. The benefit is that people already
know you, so making the sale is easier.
Paid ads: Reach out to potential customers on search engines like Bing
and Google, so your name will appear when certain keywords are searched.
Social ads: Target your audience through ads on social channels like
Twitter and Facebook, Reddit, TikTok, or LinkedIn.
Content marketing: Create and publish content (blogs, podcasts,
videos) with the goal of generating interest in your product/service.
Cold outreach: Speak directly to potential customers. This could mean
picking up the phone and calling potential customers or sending cold emails
to prospects.
Target market blogs: Sponsor posts and content on popular blogs
within your target market.
Influencer marketing: Identify and build relationships with
individuals who have influence over your target market (for example, highprofile bloggers or Instagrammers).
PR: Pitch the press and bloggers in your niche to cover your story.
SEO: Search engine optimization is another reliable way to grow your
traffic, but it takes time. Do some keyword research on sites like
AnswerThePublic or SpyFu to discover what people in your niche are
talking about. Create hyper-targeted content to drive traffic.
Giveaways: Round up some epic prizes, create a sweepstakes page . . .
and promote the shit out of it.
Collaborations: Appear on other podcasts/shows/newsletters/YouTube
channels.

CHALLENGE
Where are your customers?
Now list at least five places your customers are and how many sales in thirty
days you think you can get from them.

3. Double down on what works.
There’s a golden rule to marketing tactics I want you to repeat after me: Find what
works and double down on it; find what doesn’t work and kill it.

CHALLENGE
What marketing strategies can I double down on?
Let’s update your original marketing experiments sheet with actual sales.
This should make it obvious which experiments to double down on and which
ones to kill.

4. Make Your First 100 Customers Happier
How would you double your business if you COULD NOT get any new
customers?

CHALLENGE
Make your customers happy.
Ask one customer: “What is one thing I can do today that will make you
twice as happy with us?”
TLDR of Growth
In your MDW journal, answer these five questions:
1. What is your one goal for this year?
2. Who exactly is your customer and where can you find them?
3. What is one marketing activity you can double down on?
4. How can you delight your first 100 customers?
5. If you HAD to double your business with no money in thirty days, what
would you do?

Key things about your goals:
Don’t worry about doing everything in your dream year. Really
think about which ones would excite you. My rule of thumb is if you’re
hesitating on the dream, then it shouldn’t make your goals list.
I don’t always accomplish everything on my lists every year. And
that’s okay. This list is to help you prioritize your time, which we’ll talk
about next. You can schedule and make sure you are working toward
the things you really want to do.
Over the past ten years I’ve tried to set super-aggressive goals, but
I’ve found that it’s better to aim for more sustainable goals. It’s more
impressive to find and stick with something than burn out after being
impressive for one year.
This list works for you, not the other way around. If midyear you
realize something doesn’t matter, change it. I aim to review and update
this list only twice a year.
The best way to make sure you accomplish your goals is to see them often.
Here’s where I put mine.
On the lock screen of my phone
On a sticky on my computer
On a text file that I look at each week
On the mirror of my bathroom
On a daily note that I read every day
CHALLENGE
