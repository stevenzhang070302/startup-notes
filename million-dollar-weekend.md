Finding million dollar ideas - simple excercises to generate profitable business ideas
What was our biggest problem and did others share it? Was there a solution we were capable of creating quickly?
It is deadly to build a business without first verifying that there are paying customers.
Customers don't care about your ideas; they care about whether you can solve their problems. And you should not build your idea into a business if you don't know with 100 percent certainty that it's a solution your customers will pay for.

- Who are you selling to
- What problem you're solving
- where they are

Start with what you know
Appsumo - 
- who: found an audience of potential customers? people on reddit
- what: worked backwards to find a proble mthey wanted solved? Imgur pro at a discount
- where: time for me to flex the ask muscle and pitch some redditors

The first dollar is always the sweetest. It's momentum. It's possibility. It's fear getting its ass kicked.
Focus on Zero to $1.

No biz plan required
We get so fixated on what we want to make that we lose sight of the people who want it. - Founder First Mentality, in which entrepreneurs focus on their own experience instead of Custoemr First.

New school:
Focus on conversations with customers - dynamic back and forth
Ex: Dog walking app:
- call or text three people right now who have dogs and ask them to pay you to walk their dog
- turns out none of these dog owners have problems walking their dog - real problem is finding dog sitters when they're away
- ask for next travel dates and have them pay you a deposit

Ex: Jennifer posting to her Facebook page seeing if anyone is interested for cookies. Send an email to friends, family, coworkers. and church community members asking if interested in buying - include a paypal link.

Now where do you find customers?
Zone of influence

Challenge
Top three groups - who do you have easy access to that you'd be excited to help?

Business creation should always be a conversation!
Nearly every impulse we have is to be tight with our ideas by doing more
research, going off alone to build the perfect product—anything and
everything to avoid the discomfort of asking for money. This is the validation
shortcut. You have to learn to fight through this impulse. It won’t be easy,
but it’ll be worth it.

Become a Problem Seeker
The crucial first step toward entrepreneurship is to
study your own unhappiness and to think of solutions (aka business
opportunities) for you to sell.

The Idea Generators

people . . .

one made it?
