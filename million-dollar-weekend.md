part 1: start it
experimenting
marketting is easy with a great product
Start small, fast and not worrying aobut what I didn't know
Focus above all else on being a starter, and experimenter, a learner.

Challenge: The dollar challenge
Ask someone you know for a dollar investment in you and your future business - one measly dollar!

Magic of NOW an not how
Challenge: NOW not how
Ask one person you respect for a business idea. Don't be afraid to act. Be afraid of living a life that seems more like a resume than an adventure.

Freedom Number
To make that dream come true, you need to first choose your freedom number.

Challenge: Choosing your freedom number.

Finding million dollar ideas - simple excercises to generate profitable business ideas
What was our biggest problem and did others share it? Was there a solution we were capable of creating quickly?
It is deadly to build a business without first verifying that there are paying customers.
Customers don't care about your ideas; they care about whether you can solve their problems. And you should not build your idea into a business if you don't know with 100 percent certainty that it's a solution your customers will pay for.

- Who are you selling to
- What problem you're solving
- where they are

Start with what you know
Appsumo - 
- who: found an audience of potential customers? people on reddit
- what: worked backwards to find a proble mthey wanted solved? Imgur pro at a discount
- where: time for me to flex the ask muscle and pitch some redditors

The first dollar is always the sweetest. It's momentum. It's possibility. It's fear getting its ass kicked.
Focus on Zero to $1.

No biz plan required
We get so fixated on what we want to make that we lose sight of the people who want it. - Founder First Mentality, in which entrepreneurs focus on their own experience instead of Custoemr First.

New school:
Focus on conversations with customers - dynamic back and forth
Ex: Dog walking app:
- call or text three people right now who have dogs and ask them to pay you to walk their dog
- turns out none of these dog owners have problems walking their dog - real problem is finding dog sitters when they're away
- ask for next travel dates and have them pay you a deposit

Ex: Jennifer posting to her Facebook page seeing if anyone is interested for cookies. Send an email to friends, family, coworkers. and church community members asking if interested in buying - include a paypal link.

Now where do you find customers?
Zone of influence

Challenge
Top three groups - who do you have easy access to that you'd be excited to help?

Business creation should always be a conversation!
Nearly every impulse we have is to be tight with our ideas by doing more
research, going off alone to build the perfect product—anything and
everything to avoid the discomfort of asking for money. This is the validation
shortcut. You have to learn to fight through this impulse. It won’t be easy,
but it’ll be worth it.

Become a Problem Seeker
The crucial first step toward entrepreneurship is to
study your own unhappiness and to think of solutions (aka business
opportunities) for you to sell.

The Idea Generators
1. What’s the most painful (aka valuable) problem you can solve for
people . . .
2. That you also have passion for and/or unique expertise in . . .
3. For the largest niche possible that you belong to and understand . .

Challenges
1. Solve Your Own Problems
- What is one thing this morning that irritated me?
- What is one thing on my to-do list that’s been there over a week?
- What is one thing that I regularly fail to do well?
- What is one thing I wanted to buy recently only to find out that no
one made it?

2. Bestsellers Are Your Best Friends
- Write down two accessorizing ideas

3. Marketplaces
- Visit a marketplace like Etsy, Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or
eBay and write at least one idea for a product or service

4. Search Engine Queries

# One-minute Business Model
- Is this a million dollar opportunity?
- What's my model?
- What if it turns out it's not going to work?

Step 1. Find $1 Million Worth of Customers
Even if you’re a great surfer with an amazing board, you will still fail if
you don’t have a good wave to ride.
What I’m
saying here is that your job is not to create demand for something that seems
exciting, it’s to find existing demand and satisfy it  
In order to have a million-dollar business, you need a million-dollar
opportunity

1. Is the overall market dying, flat, or growing? You want flat or
ideally growing!
2. Is this a million-dollar opportunity? To figure that out, we have to
know the number of potential customers and the price of your product.

1. Is the market growing or dying? Search Google Trends for the
terms “beard” and “beard grooming” and compare their search
popularity to similar terms (for example, “haircuts,” “razors”) and how
that’s changed over the last few months and years. With Google Trends
you are just looking to see how the graphs are trending – ideally up and
to the right.

2. How many potential customers are there? I’d highly
recommend using Facebook Ads to research your market size.
Facebook is pretty much the entire world, and what’s phenomenal is
that they actually let you type in the keyword of whatever business
category you’re thinking about and see the approximate audience size.
You can also use the Facebook Ads Library to see every single active
ad running on Facebook for your keyword and location, which is super
helpful for uncovering competitors and getting ideas for your own
marketing efforts.

Step 2. Is This a Million-Dollar Opportunity?
Here are the major things you’re looking for:
Pick a price point you think will be ideal for your customer.
Multiply that by the number of ideal customers.
Does that equal at least a million dollars? Yes or no?
Simple!
Now let’s evaluate that on our beard oil idea:
Google Trends: Flat with some growth
Size of market: 2,500,000 people
Cost of your product: $50
Total Value: $125,000,000
Million-dollar idea? YES!

Step 3. The One-Minute Business Model
Revenue (all the money you make) – Cost (how much it costs to
make it) = Profit (what you get to take home)

PRO TIP: When you’re launching a business, always ask yourself: is
this going to be a one-off purchase, something customers buy here and there
when they want to consume it, or can you make it a monthly recurring sale?
It’s always better to be in the reorder business.
—John Paul Jones DeJoria, founder of Paul Mitchell and Patrón Spirits

Step 4. Pivot and Evolve—Your Revenue Dials

Here are the six Revenue Dials you can use:
1. Average order value: Increase the amount someone purchases.
2. Frequency: Increase how often someone will buy your service.
3. Price point: Increase or decrease your price point to affect total
sales.
4. Customer type: Approach a more lucrative/wealthier customer
segment.
5. Product line: Add additional products to make the business more
attractive to start.
6. Add-on services: If you’re selling a product like cookies, can you
offer a service like setting up birthday parties or cooking at the person’s
home?

Examples of Pivots
AppSumo started as bundle software for Silicon Valley startups
but moved to selling individual deals to marketing agencies.
Gambit started out making sports games on Facebook but found
the real opportunity in payments for social games instead.
Sam Parr’s thehustle.co went from throwing live events to
focusing just on the newsletter they used to promote the events. Fun
fact: that newsletter business sold to HubSpot for a high eight figures.

The Million-Dollar Opportunity Challenge

The hard part is not choosing which business idea. The hard part is
getting customers. And that’s where you’ll focus first.

1. Pick one business idea.
2. Make sure it’s a million-dollar opportunity.
3. Confirm your business idea is profitable.

The idea you are going to do: _____________________
Let’s check the market size:
Data/Business Idea Home Office Setup Your Idea
Google Trends Significantly up
Size of market (via Facebook Ads) 50,000
Cost $500
Market opportunity $25,000,000
Worth Pursuing? YES
If your idea is worth pursuing, now we have to make sure it’s profitable.
Calculate your profit:
Home Office Setup Your Idea
Price $ 500
Cost $ 25
Profit $ 475
Then let’s see if YOU can make a million dollars doing this business:
Home Office Setup Your Idea
Your target profit $1,000,000
Profit per unit sold $475
Total sales needed 2,105

CHAPTER 5
The 48-Hour Money Challenge
Validate Your Business by Getting Paid

Validation is finding three customers in forty-eight hours who will give you
money for your idea

Every potential business idea can be instantly verified, like your own magic wand.
The benefits of Validation are immediate and critical:
1. You don’t waste time.
2. You save money.
3. You find out if you can actually get customers for your idea.
4. You get money up front.
5. You light a fire under your butt to get moving.

The Golden Rule of Validation
Find three customers in forty-eight hours who will give you money for your idea.
Success means moving quickly and spending no money. And that’s what makes the
Golden Rule of Validation so effective. Here’s why it works so well:
You’re allowed only forty-eight hours. Limitations breed creativity.
Having a tight time limit will cut off the doubting wantrepreneur inside you
and force you to iterate fast and be creative until you find something that
works.
Get your first three customers. Your first customer is a friend, the
second customer is someone in your family, but your third customer is
HARD. You think this is easy? Then get three customers. Don’t worry about
building a business, we are ONLY validating your idea. And if it’s this hard
now, it’ll ONLY get harder.
Collect money up front. The promise of payment is not validation.
That’s polite rejection. Getting customers to hand over their dollars makes it
real. But you need to get real money, from real people. Services like PayPal,
Stripe, Cash App, and Venmo make collecting it easy these days.

You’re not trying to invent demand; you’re
trying to see how EXCITED people are about what you’re helping them with.

Three Methods to Validate ANY Business Idea
1. Direct Preselling
Validation is a conversation. Not a sales pitch, but a chat to learn about the
customer, see if you can help them and if they’ll actually pay you.

1. Listen
- What’s the most frustrating thing about what’s currently going on?
- How would having X make your life better?
- What do you think that X should cost?

2. Options
Suggest options that can solve their problems—and what they’d pay for it.
- I’ll sell you a digital course on how to fix your computer.
- What if I came over and fixed your computer myself?

3. Transition
Transition to the sell.
“So you like the idea of me coming over and fixing your computer problem. For
$50, I can do it today. Sound good?”
If they pay you, that’s Validation success.
Price + Benefit + Time.

Ex:
For $25, I will teach you how to save an hour a day on your Mac, in
just twenty minutes.
For $69, I will teach you how to write better in two hours.
For $10, I will send you a PDF with ten mind hacks that will change the
way you think in ten minutes.
For $180, I will provide six months of tasty jerky to your office this
week.

Asking for Money
There’s a big difference between what people say and what people do.
Everyone’s “interested” until they have to pay.

PRO TIP: Always follow up by sending an email to your first customers
asking for feedback. Feedback is a gift you can continually use to improve
yourself and your business.

Dealing with Rejection

That’s because every rejection is an opportunity; you can use it to take a deep
dive into customer problems. Remember the Rejection Goals from chapter 2.
Rejections are TREASURE.
When I get shot down while validating, I have a simple four-question script that
flips the no into new knowledge, new ideas, and maybe even new customers.
1. “Why not?” It’s really easy to get scared from attacking this one headon, because what happens if their criticism is right? But that’s exactly what
you want to know!
2. “Who is one person you know who would really like this?” Always,
always, always ask for a referral! Be specific about what kind of referral and
use a number; this makes it highly effective.
3. “What would make this a no-brainer for you?” If they don’t want
your product, maybe they’d want something related to it. If they don’t want
to pay for your dog care app, what about dog walking? A dog hotel? Dog
dating?
4. “What would you pay for that?” One of the hardest things in a startup
is setting prices. Getting potential customers to say what they’d pay is pure
gold!

PRO TIP: Active communications—calls and texts—work a lot better than
passive ones, like posting on Facebook or Twitter and waiting for replies. Try to
Direct Message (DM) people, or whatever enables you to get the fastest response
time possible.

2. Marketplaces
The point is, I didn’t try to find a manufacturer. I didn’t make a website. I didn’t try
to test the disc. I just said, “Will anyone actually give me money for this?” And people
did. I sold twenty of them and got an online manufacturer to make them and shipped
them to customers.
Another good technique involves posting on social media where you have an
audience of people.
My assistant Jamie was looking to develop a side hustle, so I asked her if she had
ever trained other people to be an assistant because (1) she already had the skill and
was very good at it and (2) a lot of other people wanted jobs like hers.
So she posted a message on Facebook right then: “Hey, I’m an assistant. I make a
lot of money doing it. I want to help. If you’re curious how I do it, I’m happy to help a
few other people out. Just leave a comment or message me.”

3. Landing Pages
The reason I don’t love this approach is you have to spend time setting it up and
buying ads, and when you buy ads, you have to become an ad expert. The whole
experience is slow and costly. Two things I hate.
My recommendation for you is if you feel you have to do this, limit your work to
forty-eight hours so you won’t spend a bunch of time fruitlessly playing with your ads
and landing pages or wasting money.
As an example of how to do a landing page right, take what my former intern
Justin Mares did while validating what would become the successful bone broth
company Kettle & Fire.
To start, he bought the domain bonebroths.com for $12 and set up a basic landing
page using Unbounce.
Justin paid around $5 on Fiverr to come up with the simple logo.
After setting up the page and writing the copy, he picked a price. He decided he
could make a profit if he charged $29.99 for 16 ounces. If people were willing to give
a stranger nearly $30 for a pint of a product they’d never tasted or even seen, then it
was probably destined for success.
At the site, people who hit “Order Now” got sent to a PayPal checkout, where they
were asked to send money to Justin’s email address for “Beef Marrow Bone Broth.”
The site was ugly enough to give graphic designers the cold sweats. But after
Justin bought about $50 of Bing ads, people started actually coming to the site and
PayPal-ing him money!
Over the course of the two-week test, he netted almost $500 in revenue. And now
Kettle & Fire is a $100 million company—selling broth?!?!
VALIDATED!
The key is: If you go this route, don’t overthink the design, the name, the
language, the ads, or any of that. Just focus on seeing if you can get people to buy
your product!

CHALLENGE
Validation.

Your challenge is to get at least three paying customers within forty-eight
hours.
Grab your Dream Ten list that you made earlier.
Text, call, direct message, or email—the more real time, the better!
Example script to copy:
YOU: Hey—I remember you really liked beef jerky.
POTENTIAL BUYER: Yeah, eat it all the time.
YOU: Awesome! I’m working on a new project with healthy beef jerky. Think
you’ll love it. You down to be my first customer, only $20 a month.
POTENTIAL BUYER: I don’t know, what kind of jerky?
YOU: Healthy, sourced by me, and if you don’t like it, happy to refund you.
POTENTIAL BUYER: Sounds good. Can I pay later?
YOU: Why don’t you Venmo, PayPal, or send me cash now so I can confirm
you. Only taking ten orders as part of the first batch.
POTENTIAL BUYER: Money sent.
After you’ve validated, if no one is buying, choose another idea and start over.
Head back to chapter 3 and begin again!

Social Media Is for Growth . . .
Build an Audience Who Will Support You for
Life

A community who already knows you, who follows you, who is rooting for you
is one of the most powerful forces in business, and it’s created through generosity.

People get hooked on CHARACTERS.
People do business with REAL PEOPLE. Especially those who feel like a friend.

Finding Your Unique Angle - unfair advantage
“What’s your unique angle in thirty seconds or less?”
Ex:
“I’ve been a performance coach for the last fourteen years, working with the best
athletes in the world. Helping people perform better is my groove. I want to help
anybody who wants to have a great day and shift them into the mentality to dominate
their life. I have information to share when it comes to dealing with the best.”

1. He defines who he is,
2. Why you should trust him,
3. What he is passionate about, and
4. What unique thing this prepares him to do for you

CHALLENGE
Write out your unique angle.
There are no right answers here. You can change these any time you’d like.
1. Who are you?
2. Why should people listen?
3. What are you passionate about?
4. What will you do for people?

Pick a Platform
1. Which site has the audience you want to connect with?
2. What medium do YOU enjoy creating content in?
3. What disproportionate results will you get compared to the work you
put in?

The key principle is to start right now to build your audience and then move
them to your email list (which we’ll cover in the next chapter)

CHALLENGE
Update your bio.
Choose your one platform, and using the unique angle pitch you wrote out
before, clean up and rewrite your profile/bio on that platform to reflect who you
are and how you help your ideal customer.

Creating Content for Your Core Circle

Ali uses what I call the Content Circle Framework. The basic idea is to start with
specific topics for a tiny circle to build raving fans, then slowly expand your circle of
content to influence larger groups of people.
Here are the three steps:
1. Core Circle: Start with a very narrow audience. Ali started with the
medical school exams for British people. Your niche within a niche can be
the most obscure thing imaginable, as long as it makes you and your
audience passionate.
2. Medium Circle: As you move bigger, your content should overlap
somewhat with what concerns your Core Circle, but it should appeal to a
broader audience. Ali started talking about studying and productivity in
general, since that’s required for all students.
3. Large Circle: Here you go for the largest audience possible that’s still
related. Some of Ali’s most watched videos are about his salary—made
possible by his medical video fame—or the latest Apple product—which he
uses to increase productivity. All the circles should still include your core
audience but keep expanding your circle of influence.


To get started, identify a value that a specific group of people—your Core Circle—
want and become a reliable source of information for them. Here’s a formula you can
use—outcome you’ll deliver + target market.
Here’s an example of Content Circles for a housecleaning company:
Core Circle: How to clean your evaporative cooler + in the Southwest
USA.
Medium Circle: How to choose laundry detergents + for new
homeowners.
Large Circle: The ten best vacuums + for a family.
Once you have your outcome and market figured, you need to find a unique
viewpoint in your niche.
To come up with your unique viewpoint, ask yourself a few questions:
What is something everyone thinks is true—but you think is wrong?
What is something nobody in your target market is talking about—but
should be?
What are the biggest mistakes people in your market are making—but
are totally blind to?
Ultimately, your audience wants to learn something from you that’s relevant,
useful, and surprising. And they want to do that by going on a journey with you.

CHALLENGE
Create your own Content Circle.
Think back to your validation days: Who are the customers you want to
appeal to and what’s the outcome you can create content for? What’s the unique
point of view in your content they’d be excited to hear about?
Formula = Outcome you’ll deliver + the target market
Core Circle:
Medium Circle:
Large Circle:

Be the Guide, Not the Guru
People don’t want to be lectured at by an all-knowing guru—they want to
tag along with a guide.

The goal here is to document what YOU do, not what you think everyone else
should do.

CHALLENGE
Post one piece of content.
Now it’s time to post content publicly.
Now, this piece of content can come in any format. You know I LOVE me
some YouTube, but as you’ve seen, different niches work on different platforms.
The content you create can be a YouTube video, a Twitter thread, or a blog post.
You’ve already taken the first steps in this chapter.
1. Your Unique Angle—the secret sauce nobody else has
2. The Platform you’re going to post on
3. Your Content Circle—the narrow audience who you’ll laser-target
4. Posting it TODAY

CHAPTER 7
. . . Email Is for Profit
Use Email to Make a F*&k-Ton of Money

How to use a piece of useful free content to get people excited to sign
up for your list.
How to create a simple, effective landing page and publicize it far and
wide.
How to automate your email system so it’s sending out emails to new
subscribers twenty-four hours a day.

Your Email List Is Power
Which of these options is the most valuable for your business?
A. 100 email subscribers
B. 1,000 YouTube subscribers
C. 10,000 Instagram followers
The answer may surprise you, but it’s A. Email is the king and queen of
communicating with customers.

What percentage of your list opens every email because they feel like they know
and trust you? A healthy email list has a 20 percent open rate. Target that.

Set Up a Landing Page
Your audience needs somewhere to go to actually join your email list.

CHALLENGE
Build your landing page.

Getting Your First 100 Email Subscribers
0 to 10—The Dream Ten
What’s the easiest way to start building your list? Use your existing network.
Yes, your Dream Ten. These are people who know you and care about you. The
members of this highly engaged audience are waiting to visit, subscribe to, and share
your website and content. They are your most powerful tool for knocking over that
initial subscription domino

11 to 50—Lazy Marketing
Now that you have a landing page, you’ve got to publicize it. Obviously you’re
already doing that by putting it in your calls to action inside your videos, TikToks, or
wherever you are promoting yourself online (and in their corresponding descriptions).
But you can go a lot further by putting a link to it in every point of contact you have
with others.
That means putting the landing page address in your:
Email signature
Biography on Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook
Those offer more leverage than most people think.
